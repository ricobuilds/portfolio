Hey there Shifters! I’m Enric Trillo aka RicoBuilds. If you’re a seasoned engineer, a noob learner or you’re just curious about disruptive technologies, you’ve found the right place. Let’s dive a bit into my background and what you can expect here.

## Who am I?

I’m a 25 year old developer with a passion for disruptive technologies. My journey in a country with sun, vibes & paella. I was born and raised in Madrid, I’ve lived in London since my early teens, and I’m from a small hispanic nation in Central Africa few can mark on the map – Equatorial Guinea. I come from a family of engineers, so I’ve been around technology from as early as I can remember.

## My background

My close friends and family can tell you without a doubt that ‘creativity’ and myself aren’t strangers. Back in 2014, I became a DJ and made a name for myself at 15. As someone with many interests, I picked up skills along the way. During my time at [Saint Francis Xavier](https://www.sfx.ac.uk/), between 2015 and 2017, the two skills I learned that prominently stuck with were Graphic Design and Programming. When I felt driven to design my own logo and mixtape covers, I applied the learnings from using Photoshop. This time period also marked new beginnings for me as I wrote my first line of code using Python.

Almost all of these skills overlap in nature, so it was easy for me to learn the basics, get good at them, and offer them as services as a freelancer. Eventually, it all piled up on me as a third and final year student at the [University of Northampton](https://www.northampton.ac.uk/) managing with my dissertation, and the global virus outbreak. I decided to go all in on web development, narrow down my focus, and not over-invest myself in all my interests.

We explored Artificial Intelligence as part of my third year modules, and I fell in love with it ever since then. So much so, that I achieved an A+ grade on the assignment, and wrote a [Medium article](https://medium.com/swlh/an-image-classifier-with-keras-2f0e9b868a36) on the entire process after graduating in 2020 with a BSc Hons in Computing, which got featured by The Startup publication.

After graduting in 2020, life took its turns as the global virus outbreak continued. This messed up the market for fresh graduates like myself. As for me, I wasn't going to sit around and wait, so I looked around and decided to try my luck at an outsourced sales and business strategy startup (for startups) by a former Gartner executive, local to my area.

The role started as a BDR, and quickly developed into a Hybrid SDR/BDR once I got a handle of things–prospecting on LinkedIn, outreach strategies, objection handling and more. This was a fun, and invaluable experience as someone with such a diverse career.

Since then, I continued honing my fullstack development skills and ventured into modern technologies, now that those fields are more established than before. For example, I landed a Fullstack Web3 Developer contract role at a blockchain capital firm back in 2022, and I have been also been building with AI technologies.

I'm revisiting old skills I haven't touched in a while, and new skills I want to develop. So, I'll take you aboard this journey I'm pursuing to become a multi-disciplinary developer that thrives in the face of a future world with AI. I'm excited for the road ahead.

## Current focus

Right now, I’m focused on a few exciting projects:

- Content Creation – Sharing my knowledge and insights about the latest in disruptive technologies, exploring the Shifter philosophy and my personal journey
- Upskilling – Learning new skills to develop a robust skillset I can leverage that will help me thrive in our future world with AI
- Framer Plug – A design and development studio focused on delivering nocode solutions using Framer.

## Parting note

I’m here to share, but also learn from you. Your insights, questions and feedback are invaluable. So, don’t be shy – let’s connect on social media and build something amazing together. And with that...

Welcome to Ricobuilds.
